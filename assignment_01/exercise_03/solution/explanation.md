#Explanation

In the program r and s are lambda functions or anonymous functions and q is the argument to both of the functions. In first step we have initialized x to 2. In second step we have passed x as argument to the lambda function r, this will return x*2 which is stored in x. That is, x = 4 now. Similarly in third step we have passed x to lambda function s, So x = 4*3. i.e, x = 12 now. Again in the last step, x is multiplied by 2 by passing it to function r. Therefore, x = 24.
