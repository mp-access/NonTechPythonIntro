# Template Course Repo
This Repo is an example for a course that can be used as a template for other courses. Have a look at the repo contents, we included an assignment with exercises of each supported type and with config and description files.

The following exercise-types are supported in our current version:
* code
* codeSnippet
* text
* single Choice
* multiple Choice

## How to get started
You should have received a preconfigured and registered repo from us, containing this template. The contained assignment1 has its dueDate in the config set in the past, it will therefore not appear in the public listings. You can keep it as a reference point in your repository. You can simply copy the assignment folder and then make the necessary adjustments.
